<h1>🛡️ Spriggan</h1>

##Spriggan is a lightweight Python tool focused on encrypting and decrypting sensitive data in a simple, fast, and reusable way.
It’s designed for personal projects, scripts, and small utilities.

This project was built along my cybersecurity journey, with the purpose of spreading awareness about the dangers of attackers once
our systems are compromised

##🚀 Features
*🔐 Encrypt text or data securely
*🔓 Decrypt previously encrypted content
*🧩 Terminal User-friendly interface

##📦 Installation

###Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and git installed on your system.

First, clone the repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/Usupru/Spriggan.git
cd Spriggan

(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
````
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
````

Install dependencies (if any):
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

###⚙️ Usage

Spriggan can be used directly from the terminal.

###🔐 Encrypting data

Run the encryption script and provide the text you want to protect:
````
python spriggan.py
````

Follow the on-screen instructions to input the text.
Spriggan will return an encrypted output.

###🔓 Decrypting data

To decrypt previously encrypted content:

````
python decrypt.py
````

Paste the encrypted string when prompted, and Spriggan will restore the original data.

###🧠 Notes

*This tool is intended for educational and personal use
*Ideal for learning about basic encryption concepts and data protection
*Not meant to replace enterprise-grade security solutions
